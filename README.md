# B.E ECE Notes

Welcome to the ECE Notes project! The notes here, on our Website, and on Google Drive are for courses under the "19" regulation. Our college now uses the "23" regulation, so new students might find these materials less relevant.

This project aimed to assist students, and I hope it helped those under the "19" regulation as much as it did for me. Feel free to connect with me at [mohammedadhil0408@gmail.com](mailto\:mohammedadhil0408@gmail.com).

## Identify Your Course Regulation:

- "19XXXXXXT" = 19 regulation
- "23XXXXXXT" = 23 regulation

Thank you for visiting, and good luck with your studies!\

## üí´ Motivation

Before I switched to on-campus courses, I took all of my classes online and hardly interacted with any upperclassmen. Without assistance, it was difficult for me to locate relevant readings and organize my time effectively to succeed in exams. Even if we moved to a traditional format, it still wouldn't be easy to use study materials effectively.

You'll hardly have any contact with your seniors unless you're part of a club, project, or research paper. I've made this repo to support anyone looking for relevant study materials.
